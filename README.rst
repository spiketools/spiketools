``spiketools`` is a collection of tools and utilities for analyzing spiking data.

Overview
--------

``spiketools`` is an open-source module for processing and analyzing single-unit activity from neuro-electrophysiological recordings.

Available sub-modules in ``spiketools`` include:

- ``measures`` : measures and conversions that can be applied to spiking data
- ``objects`` : objects that can be used to manage spiking data
- ``spatial`` : space related functionality and measures
- ``stats`` : statistical measures for analyzing spiking data
- ``sim`` : simulations of spiking activity and related functionality
- ``plts`` : plotting functions for visualizing spike data and related measures
- ``utils`` : additional utilities for working with spiking data

Scope
-----

``spiketools`` is currently organized around analyses of single cell activity.

The current scope does not include population measures, though this may be extended in the future.

Note that ``spiketools`` does *not* cover spike sorting.
Check out `spikeinterface <https://github.com/SpikeInterface/>`_ for spike sorting.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation for ``spiketools`` is available
`here <https://spiketools.github.io/>`_.

The documentation includes:

- `Tutorials <https://spiketools.github.io/spiketools/auto_tutorials/index.html>`_:
  which describe and provide examples for each sub-module
- `API List <https://spiketools.github.io/spiketools/api.html>`_:
  which lists and describes everything available in the module
- `Glossary <https://spiketools.github.io/spiketools/glossary.html>`_:
  which defines key terms used in the module

If you have a question about using ``spiketools`` that doesn't seem to be covered by the documentation, feel free to
open an `issue <https://github.com/spiketools/spiketools/issues>`_ and ask!

Dependencies
------------

``spiketools`` is written in Python, and requires Python >= 3.7 to run.

It has the following required dependencies:

- `numpy <https://github.com/numpy/numpy>`_
- `pandas <https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas>`_
- `scipy <https://github.com/scipy/scipy>`_
- `matplotlib <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib>`_

There are also optional dependencies, that offer extra functionality:

- `statsmodels <https://github.com/statsmodels/statsmodels>`_
  is needed for some statistical measures, for example ANOVAs
- `pytest <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest>`_
  is needed to run the test suite locally
